        <p>Hello! I'm <em>Jeongyeon Yim</em> from South Korea. I love music and art, so I sometimes go to the concert or exhibition. I can play the piano and violin, and I am also interested in many other traditional instruments. I enjoy trying new things especially traveling around the world with having new experiences in different cultures.</p>
        <p>I'm in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program which has several great courses, and this is my 1<sup>st</sup> term. I'm here to start a new career in media industry but still not very sure what to do and what I can do well. After trying different part of media design, I hope that I can find the way successfully.</p>
